# ambience script

Plays ambience music in your terminal.

The sources are configured in `./src/ambience/_sources.py` file, feel free to
edit it.

It needs `mpv` and `youtube-dl` or `yt-dlp` to work.

Install with make build, it will create an executable (with shiv) on
~/.local/bin

I have configured a binding on hyprland to open with a keybind, very nice.
